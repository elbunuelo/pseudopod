As of now, this is a library to control your iPod using a raspberry Pi

## What's implemented:

Simple remote functionality.

## What's not implemented yet:

Advanced remote functionality.

## Where this project is headed:

My goal with this project is to implement the ipod accessory protocol from
both client (docking) and host (iPod) sides, in order to make my car believe
that there's an iPod connected when I connect my raspberry Pi using the iPod
interface
